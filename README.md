# Processing Sketchez
This is a dedicated repository to contain my Processing sketches. These sketches are written in Java and can be exported to multiple platforms using Processing IDE. This repository **does not** contain platform specific applications, it's just the code. This series of `sketchez` is a baby right now, it'll expand, get its own web navigation, etc. sometime soon.
